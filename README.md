# PipCraft - ResourcePack edition

## About

This is the companion resourcepack to the PipCraft Minecraft Modpack.

The largest feature are the Vanilla-style textures for Geolosys ores. These were created by KaneThornwyrd and released as [Minecraftic Geolosys](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mod-ctm-minecraftic-geolosys). The textures are licensed [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/). The one change I have made is to remove the CTM as I didn't want it, however I still wanted CTM available in the pack in general.

The other addition is stone-style textures for Tinkers' Construct Cobalt and Ardite ores. This was achieved by merely referencing their resources, they aren't actually included in the resourcepack. So I don't believe there are any licensing issues to consider.
